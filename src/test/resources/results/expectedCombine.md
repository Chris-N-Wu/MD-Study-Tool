# Java Arrays
- An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type

## Declaring an Array
- General Form: type[] arrayName;
- ex: int[100]
- more important data
- only creates a reference
- no array has actually been created yet
- references are good

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- General form: arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];
- numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.
- Gotcha: Array size is not modifiable once instantiated.

# Testing Edge Cases
- This is important, this is some text in the middle, MORE MIDDLE STUFF, and there's some space

# Vectors
- Vectors act like resizable arrays

## Declaring a vector
- General Form: Vector\<type> v = new Vector();
- type needs to be a valid reference type

## Adding an element to a vector
- v.add(object of type);
