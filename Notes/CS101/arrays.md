# Java Arrays
- [[An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type]], referred to
  by a common name.
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime).

## Declaring an Array
- [[General Form: type[] arrayName;]]
- [[ex: int[100]]] myData [[more important data]];

- The above [[only creates a reference]] to an array object, but [[no array has 
  actually been created yet]] but there's more text here [[references are good]]

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- [[General form: arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];]]
- ex: myData = new int[100];

- Data types of the reference and array need to match.
- [[numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.]]
- [[Gotcha: Array size is not 
-  modifiable once instantiated.]]
- some more text ]]

# Testing Edge Cases
- [[This is important, 
- this is some text in the middle
, MORE MIDDLE STUFF
- , and there's some space]]
